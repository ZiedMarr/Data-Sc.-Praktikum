1- remove rows that had protest==0 :
	stored in : no_protest0_df 

2-Adding clean_identity variable :
	-Type : String
	-has the following values : "students" , "farmers" , "farmers & students" , "other"
		-> there were some rows where both were present hence the & variable
	-classified by checking if the variable protesteridentity contains "student" or "farmer" or both or neither (case unsensitive)
	-stored in data_with_new_var

3-selecting only the useful columns : 
	-the variables : year, country, protesterviolence, protesterdemand1, protesterdemand2,
         protesterdemand3, protesterdemand4, stateresponse1, stateresponse2,
         stateresponse3, stateresponse4, stateresponse5, stateresponse6,
         stateresponse7, gwf_democracy, clean_identity
	-stored in clean_data

4-Adding a variable state_violence : 
	-Type : boolean
	-=1 if : stateresponse{1,..7} contains one of the following values : 2,3,6 or 7
	-=0 else
	-stored in clean_plus_violence
5-Removing rows that have gwf_democracy==N/A (years>2010)
	-stored in final_cleaned_df

4.1-filtering the cleaned data frame to only contain students (and "students & farmers")
